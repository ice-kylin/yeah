## How does it work?

YEAH consists of an optional Rust Axum backend server and a frontend page built using Astro and Svelte.

YEAH can be configured to automatically switch between component configurations (e.g. different link addresses) in
different network environments. It is also possible to configure YEAH as a completely static page, without a backend
server (this disables some features).
